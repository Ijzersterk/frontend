    <p>We: Daniël Colon, Ruud Kassing, Pouja Nikray and Daniël Schooneveld, started the association in 2015 with the following goals:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To share reliable and trustworthy information about strength training in general.</li>
        <li>To share knowledge and expertise between athletes of different disciplines.</li>
        <li>To participate in competitions together.</li>
        <li>To give seminars and trainings.</li>
        <li>And most of all: to train together and to motivate each other in accomplishing our personal goal(s).</li>
    </ol>
